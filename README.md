On open, you're immediately prompted for entry. No need to navigate a homescreen and tap "enter weight" ‚Äî that's why you downloaded the app, right? 

<h1>Motivation</h1>
Got tired of the terrible options avaiable ‚Äî Ads, Sign up BS, bloated menus to sift through. I just wanna wake up and enter my weight with a simple UI/UX and relaxing color scheme
